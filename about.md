[endCoronavirus.org](http://localhost:8888/) is built and maintained by the [New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI)](https://necsi.edu/) and collaborators. Our goal is to minimize the impact of COVID-19 by providing useful data and guidelines for action.

Our research team has co-faculty, students and affiliates from MIT, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities nationally and internationally. We are working around the clock to monitor and communicate the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic.

We employ a range of mathematical tools designed for systems with many interacting components in which traditional statistical assumptions break down.

We specialize in networks, agent-based modeling, multi-scale analysis, and complexity, and have applied our approaches to evolution, ecology, biodiversity, altruism, systems biology, cellular response, health care, systems engineering, negotiation, military conflict, ethnic violence, and international development.
