title: What should I do if I believe that I have COVID-19?
---
  Begin by isolating yourself from the community. The majority of those who
  contract COVID-19 experience mild symptoms that can be managed home. If there are others in your household, limit contact by staying in one room and sanitize shared surfaces frequently. Wear a face mask when interacting with those in your household, and clean your hands often.

  Next, arrange to be tested for COVID-19 by contacting your local health  authorities. Call your local health department to notify them of your symptoms as well as your travel history and any potential points of contact that you may have had with the coronavirus. If medical attention is needed, wear a face mask and find a safe way to travel to the facility â€“ avoid public transportation or ride share services.

  Health care facilities are under a great deal of stress, so be persistent if you believe that you have COVID-19. If officials deny your request for testing, you may want to document your experiences and share this information with local news outlets and social media.
