title: How is COVID-19 transmitted?
---
  COVID-19 is spread through contact with other infected individuals. The virus spreads when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales, releasing droplets into the air and onto surrounding surfaces.

  People can catch COVID-19 by breathing in these droplets, or by touching an infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. To reduce the spread of COVID-19, it is of utmost importance that everyone near affected areas take strong measures to reduce connectivity.

  We strongly recommend reviewing our guidelines for detailed recommendations on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
