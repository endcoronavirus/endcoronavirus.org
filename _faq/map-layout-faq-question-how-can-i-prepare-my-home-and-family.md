title: Should I wear a face mask?
---

  The use of masks is debated, we note that:

  (1) Any individual who has even mild symptoms should avoid contact with others and should wear a mask while in necessary public or private contact with others.


  (2) Wearing a mask should be accepted in public settings to prevent those who are sick from hesitating to or feeling stigmatized by wearing a mask.


  (3) While masks do not guarantee safety for a healthy individual and their availability may be limited because of higher priority need in medical settings, using masks where proximity to others who may be infected canâ€™t be avoided dramatically reduces the risk of infection.


  (4) For those who are over 50 or have preexisting health conditions, as well as for those in areas of heightened risk, the large cost of being infected justifies the use of a mask. While not ideal, reusable washable masks can be made by hand, and they are needed for protection in hospitals, nursing homes, rehab centers, group homes and other group settings.
