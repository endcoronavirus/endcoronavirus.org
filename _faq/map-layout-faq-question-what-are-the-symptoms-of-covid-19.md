title: What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
---
  Symptoms of COVID-19 commonly include fever, coughing, and tiredness. Some
  patients also experience aching, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or  diarrhoea. Most people recover from this virus without needing special
  treatment, but some may become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing.
  Older people, and those with existing medical problems like heart problems,
  high blood pressure, or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe symptoms.
