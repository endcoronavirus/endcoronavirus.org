title: How can I protect myself and others from this virus?
---
  Begin by cleaning your hands thoroughly and frequently!

  Hands can pick up the coronavirus through contact with infectious droplets.  Scrub hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, then rinse and dry. If soap and  water are not available, an alcohol-based sanitizer can also kill viruses that
  are on your hands.

  Between hand washings, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth to keep  viruses from entering your body. If someone near you is coughing or sneezing,  maintain at least 3 feet of distance to avoid inhaling droplets that may  contain a virus. If you are coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose  with your bent elbow or a tissue. Most importantly, if you feel unwell, stay  home. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, call your
  healthcare provider to learn how to seek medical attention.

  We strongly recommend reviewing our guidelines for detailed recommendations  for individuals, communities, businesses, and governments.
