question: How is COVID-19 treated?
answer: >-
  There is no anti-viral treatment for COVID-19. Because this disease is caused
  by a virus, antibiotics are also not effective. People with fever, cough, and
  difficulty breathing should seek medical care early to alleviate the symptoms
  and reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection.
